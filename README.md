## Installation

The basic setup of the package is really straight forward, create a instance of `SubtitleController` with a `subtitleUrl` or `subtitlesContent` depending if your resource is remote or local. 

Unfortunately currently its required to specify the subtitle type so `webvtt` or `srt` .

After this you need to wrap your video player with the `SubTitleWrapper` and add the `SubtitleController` and `videoPlayerController` to the `SubTitleWrapper` . That's it :tada:

``` dart
 final SubtitleController subtitleController = SubtitleController(
    subtitleUrl: "https://pastebin.com/raw/ZWWAL7fK",
    subtitleType: SubtitleType.webvtt,
  );
  
 SubTitleWrapper(
       videoPlayerController: videoPlayerController,
       subtitleController: subtitleController,
       subtitleStyle: SubtitleStyle(
         textColor: Colors.white,
         hasBorder: true,
       ),
       videoChild: Chewie(
         controller: chewieController,
       ),
	),
```
